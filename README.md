- "[AI Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai) is a showcase for simple
experiments that make it easier for anyone to start exploring machine learning, through pictures,
drawings, language, music, and more."

- [AI Platforms](https://towardsdatascience.com/top-artificial-intelligence-platforms-for-2020-80570c65c1b4)

  - Google's [Cloud AI Platform](https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform/) → free computational power,
  API, storage space, etc.

  - [IBM Watson Studio](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio): "Build, run and manage AI models.
  Prepare data and build models anywhere using open source code or visual modeling. Predict and
  optimize your outcomes."
  
  - [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) → web-deployable model!
  
- [Open AI](https://openai.com), with a powerful API (in beta as of Sept. 16, 2020) and links to many projects and papers
